# PharmaDatabase

This features a normalized relational database for efficiently storing and manipulating information about pharmaceutical samples. This was inspired by my work in biotech. I am currently working on a full-stack project utilizing React and Django along with Django REST framework to build a full application that can be used. This was inpired by the Labware LIMS software, which is a standard for controlling sample flow in pharmaceuticals. The in-progress project is listed under the LISMS repository.
